# Natural-Language-Part-of-Speech-Tagger

This project explores different methods for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which is the process of assigning a part of speech (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a sentence. The methods we investigate include hidden Markov models (HMM) with the Viterbi algorithm, bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) tagger, BiLSTM tagger that includes the word's case as an input, and a baseline POS tagger classifier that uses word counts and the most common POS tags.
